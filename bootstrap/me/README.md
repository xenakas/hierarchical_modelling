- [ ] [Maximum Entropy, Time Series and
Statistical Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.1504.pdf): criticism

This allows the elements of a time series, no matter how
few in number, to be included and hence influence the resulting distribution. This method
has several advantages, most notably that the elements of the time series can be put into
the computation without difficulty and without complication whether the series is short or
long

That is, for a short series, a small
number of new data points may make a considerable change in the numerical values of the pi;
this is in contrast with the traditional ME approach, but perhaps is a more realistic property
of statistical inference
