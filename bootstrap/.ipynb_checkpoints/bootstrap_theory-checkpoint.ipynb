    "Bootstrapping is a well-known technique used to estimate the properties of an statistic. It was developed by Bradley Efron in 1979. The most common use cases include estimating variances and/or confidence intervals. Also, we have already seen how to apply it to portfolio management here on Quantdare. The technique is conceptually very simple: it relies on random sampling with replacement. The general idea is that by doing so we are effectively sampling from a distribution that matches the empirical distribution of the current sample, which can be seen as an approximation of sampling from the actual population distribution. It is a very simple and powerful approach that allows approximating the solution of problems that would be, otherwise, impossible or very tedious to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And that is exactly what we are seeing; by sampling randomly without constraints, we are destroying the time-dependence structure in the time series.
