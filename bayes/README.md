Kalman Filter,  Conditionally Independent Hierarchical method,  BVAR.  Time series forecasting of demand for goods or services
 often involves cases subject to structural change caused
 by external influences like business cycles or competi-
 tors' actions. Methods designed for such cases, like ex-
 ponential smoothing (Brown 1962) and the Multi-State
 Kalman Filter (MSKF) method (Harrison and Stevens
 1971), revise model parameter estimates over time.
