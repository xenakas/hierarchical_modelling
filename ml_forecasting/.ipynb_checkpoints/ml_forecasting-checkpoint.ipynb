    "An early attempt to tackle this was to use a simple feedback type approach for neurons in the network where the output was fed-back into the input to provide context on the last seen inputs. These were called Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Whilst these RNNs worked to an extent, they had a rather large downfall that any significant uses of them lead to a problem called the Vanishing Gradient Problem. We will not expand on the vanishing gradient issue any further than to say that RNNs are poorly suited in most real-world problems due to this issue, hence, another way to tackle context memory needed to be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network came to the rescue. Like RNN neurons, LSTM neurons kept a context of memory within their pipeline to allow for tackling sequential and temporal problems without the issue of the vanishing gradient affecting their performance."
