    "The options available for forecasting are many, even when only the level of disaggregation is considered. \n",

In support of this view, Granger (1990) show that the summing\n",

    "The theoretical literature supports using the disaggregate forecasts, or bottom-up approach, but the results in the empirical literature are mixed. Ultimately, whether the\n",

    "An option to improve forecasting performance in this setting, is to work on the modelling, that include disaggregate information in a direct aggregate approach or include common factors\n",
