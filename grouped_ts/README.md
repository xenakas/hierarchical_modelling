ARIMA models can be implemented as State Space models (R's arima does this, under the hood), also known as Dynamic Linear models (DLMs). DLMs are also extensions from regression (in a different way than Mixed Effects), so I'd guess that there is a deep-down relationship between ARIMA and Mixed-effect models.

Multilevel modelling is a name for models that have both fixed and random effects 


If you mean RE, yes you are right, and yes the Mundlak formulation will help if there are unobserved country-level factors linked to GDP that you want to control for. But this also uses up degrees of freedom. Without Mundlak, RE uses less degrees of freedom (because the random effects are assumed part of a distribution, only the variance of that distribution needs to be estimated, and you don't need a parameter for each RE).

### DLM

Dynamic Bayesian models are developed for application in
nonlinear, non-normal time series and regression problems,
providing dynamic extensions of standard generalized linear
models
