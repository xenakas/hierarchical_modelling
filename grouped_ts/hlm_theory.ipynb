    "ARIMA models can be implemented as State Space models (R's arima does this, under the hood), also known as Dynamic Linear models (DLMs). DLMs are also extensions from regression (in a different way than Mixed Effects), so I'd guess that there is a deep-down relationship between ARIMA and Mixed-effect models.\n",

But this also uses up degrees of freedom. Without Mundlak, RE uses less degrees of freedom (because the random effects are assumed part of a distribution, only the variance of that distribution needs to be estimated, and you don't need a parameter for each RE).\n",
