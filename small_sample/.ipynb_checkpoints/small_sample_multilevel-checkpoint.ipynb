    " I don't know of any small sample studies that have gone beyond two-levels. In two-level models, without using any small sample correction (e.g., Kenward-Roger), with continuous outcomes, about 20 units are needed at the highest level to obtain unbiased estimates (power will be quite low though). With discrete outcomes, about 50 units are needed at the highest level with at least 5 observations per cluster. \n",
