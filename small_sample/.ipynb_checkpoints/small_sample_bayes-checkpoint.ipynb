    "Hoyle suggested several ways to strategically think about adjustments in the study plan that would help to support inference in a small sample situation. He showed a general t-test—the ratio of a parameter estimate to its standard error. If the goal is to detect a significant effect, there are two options for increasing t: increase the parameter estimate or decrease the standard error."

    "Louis said that, as discussed by Hoyle, regression functions and equations are attractive. However, he said that he would focus on Bayesian empirical-based hierarchal models that borrow information across units. Bayesian formalism, the engine of Bayesian analysis, forces thinking that produces effective approaches. He gave an example of trading off bias and variance for a linear model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing in the Bayesian approach eliminates the hard work needed to develop a good model, he stressed. The regression model can be used to produce estimates that may be quite stable; however, the unit-level estimates are likely to be biased. Now there are two estimates, the direct estimate that is unbiased but has high variance, and the regression estimate that may be biased but has lower variance. In this context, Bayesian modeling suggests a middle ground—an estimate that is partway between the direct estimate and the regression estimate. The Bayes estimate is a third estimate, a weighted average of the direct estimate and the regression estimate. The weight applied to the direct estimate will be close to 1 if the direct estimate has low variance relative to the regression estimate. However, if the direct estimate has high variance relative to the regression estimate, the weight on the regression estimate will be higher."
