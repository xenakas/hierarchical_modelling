    "Using least squares estimation, or some other non-regularized estimation method, it is possible to estimate a model only if you have more observations than parameters.  (If you use the LASSO, or some other regularization technique, it is possible to estimate a model with fewer observations than parameters.) However, there is no guarantee that a fitted model will be any good for forecasting, especially when the data are noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The only reasonable approach is to first check that there are enough observations to estimate the model, and then to test if the model performs well out-of-sample. With short series, there is not enough data to allow some observations to be witheld for testing purposes. However, the AIC can be used as a [proxy for the one-step forecast out-of-sample MSE](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/aic/). The AIC allows both the number of parameters and the amount of noise to be taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What tends to happen with short series is that the AIC suggests very simple models because anything with more than one or two parameters will produce poor forecasts due to the estimation error.  After applying the auto.arima() function from the forecast package in R to all the series from the M-competition, 32 of 144 series had models with zero parameters (random walks), 95 had models with one parameter.\n",

    "Seasonal models bring their own difficulties because the seasonality usually takes up m-1 \n",
    " degrees of freedom where \n",
    "m\n",
    " is the seasonal period. Fourier terms are one way to reduce the problem â€” useful whenever the ratio of \n",
    "m\n",
    " to sample size is large. \n",

    " Consequently, at least $p+q+P+Q+d+mD+1$ observations\n",
