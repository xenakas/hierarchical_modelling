    "### Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Most analyses are\n",
    "based on the assumption that the probabilistic properties\n",
    "of the underlying system are time-invariant; that is, the\n",
    "focused process is steady. Although this assumption is very\n",
    "useful to construct simple models, it does not seem to be\n",
    "the best strategy in practice. The reason is that systems\n",
    "with time-varying probabilistic properties are common in\n",
    "practical engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we can construct regression\n",
    "model with a few data points, accurate prediction cannot\n",
    "be achieved from the simplicity of linear model.\n",
    "Therefore,\n",
    "linear methodology is sometimes inadequate for situations\n",
    "where the relationships between the samples are not linear with time, and then artificial intelligence techniques, such as\n",
    "expert system and neural network, have been developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, [grey theory](http://help.prognoz.com/en/mergedProjects/Lib/02_time_series_analysis/grey.htm) constructs a grey differential equation to predict with as few as four data points by accumulated generating operation\n",
    "technique. Though the grey prediction model has been\n",
    "successfully applied in various fields and has demonstrated\n",
    "satisfactory results, its prediction performance still could be\n",
    "improved, because the grey forecasting model is constructed\n",
    "of exponential function. Consequently, it may derive worse\n",
    "prediction precise when more random data sets exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The K-nearest neighbor approach__ is conceptually simple to pattern recognition problems, where an\n",
    "unknown pattern is classified according to the majority of the\n",
    "class memberships of its K-nearest neighbors in the training\n",
    "set. Moreover, local prediction, proposed by Farmer\n",
    "and Sidorowich [[Predicting chaotic time series](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.845)], derives forecasting based on a suitable\n",
    "statistic of the next values assigned L previous samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We place ourselves in a parametric probabilistic forecast-\n",
    "ing framework under small sample size, for which simple\n",
    "linear models are recommended, such as AR model and grey\n",
    "prediction model, because these simple linear models are\n",
    "frequently found to produce smaller prediction errors than\n",
    "techniques with complicated model forms due to their parsimonious form.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, two issues should be noticed.\n",
    "- On one hand, linear approaches may output unsatisfactory forecasting accuracy when the focused system illustrates a nonlinear trend.  Mass work on model structural change has been conducted. To settle this problem, similar with the basic idea of K-nearest neighbor and local prediction approaches, many scholars have recommended using only recent data to increase future forecasting accuracy if chaotic data exist. Based on this point of view, grey model GM(1,1) rolling model, called rolling check, was proposed by Wen. The same technique called grey prediction with rolling mechanism (GPRM) can only be utilized in one-step prediction.\n",
    "- On the other hand, an AR model can only be established for time series that satisfies the stationarity condition; that is, a stationary solution to the corresponding AR characteristic equation exists if and only if all roots exceed unity in absolute value (modulus). Consequently, AR models cannot be established for modeling nonstationary time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivated by the GPRM approach and the practical\n",
    "relevance of very short-term forecasting or 1-step-ahead\n",
    "prediction elucidated above, the first objective of this study\n",
    "is to construct a novel prediction model with the rolling\n",
    "mechanism to improve the forecasting precision. Therefore,\n",
    "the sample data set and model parameters are evolved in\n",
    "each prediction step. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second objective of this study is to\n",
    "develop an autoregressive model that can be used to model\n",
    "nonstationary time series. Consequently, this autoregression\n",
    "is different from the AR model in the time series analysis\n",
    "literature. We also call it autoregression, because the current\n",
    "value of the series is also a linear combination of several most\n",
    "recent past values of itself plus an “innovation” term that\n",
    "incorporates everything new in the series that is not explained\n",
    "by the past values, but it can be used to model nonstationary\n",
    "time series."
