    "To calculate the Bayesian predictive distribution, $\\pi(x|D)$, given some data $D$,  we simply multiply the density function of the classical solution  $\\ell (D|x)$,  with the density function produced by our prior knowledge $\\pi(x)$. This is a direct application of Bayesâ€™ theorem. Unfortunately, this product will not integrate to one. To overcome this, we multiply the density function by a constant $Z$, which rescales the density so that it does integrate to one. The resulting Bayesian distribution defined over the n-dimensional parameter space $S$ is\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ Z = \\int_S \\pi(x) \\ell(D|x) dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In one dimension it is easy to use numerical quadrature to calculate $Z$. However as the dimension becomes large, this method quickly becomes impractical. So we turn to a class of statistical algorithms known as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which can tackle these high dimensional parameter spaces.\n",
